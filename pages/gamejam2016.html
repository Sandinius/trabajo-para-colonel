                <h2>Harry Potter and The 9 to 5 Job</h2>
                <p>This was my first jam I ever participated! It was hosted by my college, Escuela Da Vinci, as part of a Harry Potter event where, alongside other activities for other careers, they did this one for the students at Game Development!
                    Besides the Harry Potter theme, there was an additional prompt: "It isn't like before". And the game had to be delivered in 12 hours! It was a jam that ran from 9pm to 9am</p>

                <h2>Development</h2>
                <p>For this project, we brainstorm the idea of making a Rhythm game with randomized notes. Narratively, Harry is now working in the Ministery of Magic, done with the excitement and adventuring from his youth, now stuck in a white collar job doing paperwork. Indeed it's not like before... Gameplay wise, the randomized notes meant that no 2 game sessions would be the same, fulfilling the prompt for the Jam!
                    I worked as the artist for all the moveable assets in the game, and concept the background for our game, this was easly done using Adobe Photoshop. Our Game Designer did the documentation, direction and background for the game. And our developer created the core functions of our game using Construct 2.</p>

                <h2>Delivery</h2>
                <p>At 9am, we had to deliver our game, and fun fact, not only I was extremely tired and sleepy, the gamejam started at thursday 9pm... and I had classes for friday 9AM! Yes, after the delivery of our game, I had to sprint into class inmediatly after that!
                    But it was not in vain, for after class at 1PM, before returning to my home and get some rest, I was informed our game won the 1st place for the gamejam!
                    I returned home with a huge smile on my face...and closed eyes from the sleep!</p>
