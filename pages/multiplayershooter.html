                <h2>Cellebratory Medals</h2>
                <p>These medals were awarded to the team that worked at Fortnite Creative by Nimble Giant Entertainment. The medals stands as a testament to the many long days of hard work in an industry that I’m deeply passionate about. This journey has been more than just a job—it’s been an opportunity to pour my heart and soul into a project that I’ve grown to love with every challenge and milestone. Being part of a team that strives to create something truly special has been an inspiring and rewarding experience. I’m grateful for the opportunity to contribute to a game that not only excites players but has also become a personal passion of mine. Here's to many more adventures ahead!</p>
