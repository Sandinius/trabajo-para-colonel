                <h2>Casa Tomada</h2>
                <p>This was my third gamejam, hosted by Nimble Giant Entertainment and organized by Global Game Jam, lasting a whole weekend. The prompt for this gamejam was simply: "Home".</p>

                <h2>Development</h2>
                <p>This time, I didn't know anyone from the stablishment, but luckily found a team that needed an artist! So we were a full team, designer, developer and artist (me!).
                    During our brainstorm, we settled by a asymmetric multiplayer game, where a person living in a mansion needs to escape from the stablishment before the ghost catches them, inspired by a Julio Cort√°zar's tale. The catch was that while the Human player could see their character on screen, the Ghost player only saw themselves through a map, so they had to guess where their opponent was going and catch them in that room. This was a really unique way to make a multiplayer game that we didn't see before.
                    I worked as the artist creating all the visual elements of the game, except the menu. For this I used Aseprite. Our Developer created the movement for the ghost while our designer did the controls for the human.

                <h2>Delivery</h2>
                <p>After 48 hours, we've finished the game and delivered it fully ready. Then we watched everyone's projects and it was time to expose ours! I've played alongside our developer as the ghost, catching them a couple of times while our designer explained our project. It was a really fun game experience even though a couple of bugs where found. But overall it was a great time.
                    And this time our games weren't judged, we simply did games for us. This did calm me a bit as I didn't had to rush anything or being really critical of my job, I just had to do my part and finished it, and I'm glad I did!</p>
