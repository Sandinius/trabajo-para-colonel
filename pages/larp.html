                <h2>Live Action Role Play</h2>
                <p>Also known as LARP, a friend created a group of staff members to create a new way to play RPGs in Argentina. 
                    Joined in 2019, I took the role as Game Designer, helping with documentation, creating new systems, propose new mechanics, fix known issues. And in July 2024, I was assigned as Larp Director, so I had to create a brand new narrative campaing, the themes and aesthetics, set the gameplay and narrative intentions, define the pillars and values for the experience, decide what mechanics to introduce into the game and what not to add.</p>

                <h2>Core Gameplay</h2>
                <p>The defining factor for our system is the complete analogue use of objects, unlike a standard TTRPG (TableTop Role Playing Game, like Dungeons & Dragons) we do not use character sheets (A list of stats, buffs, and debuffs a character might have to represent the character and easier for the player to play them) nor dice, everything the player needs to do, has to be done in person face to face, no dice or stat can help!
                    So if a player wants to steal a guards bag, they can't just roll for Stealth, they need to get close, create a distraction, seek the opportunity, and take it! If a player needs to get past a door monitored by a guard, the player needs to get to their face, talk to them and try to charm them to let them in. No Charisma roll needed.</p>

                <h2>Modularity and Mistery</h2>
                <p>Something very special we do for our game is the use of mistery and modularity. In every session, we always try to add something new and unique for the experience, something just few players can experiment. This is to create mistery and intrigue so players are excited to play the next session in a couple of months (there's a lot of preparation between session to session) as they never get the complete package of our experience, it's always a chonk of it.
                    To do this, we take opportunity from our modular system! We have plenty of activities, settings, mechanics and systems that they can vary from campaing to campaign, but still maintaining the story from the previous session, as players actions have weight in the campaing's story.</p>
