                <h2>Glutton Party</h2>
                <p>This was the second gamejam I participated, it was hosted by my college, Escuela Da Vinci, and it lasted a whole weekend. For this jam, the only prompt we had was phrase from Leonardo Da Vinci: "Those who owns more is more afraid of losing it"</p>

                <h2>Development</h2>
                <p>After the brainstorm session, we determined our game would be a Hotdog Eating Contest Party Game. The objective of the game was to eat as many hotdogs as possible without losing it all by throwing up... delicious! This was a very unique idea that wasn't done in the jam, and we were really proud of this concept.
                    I worked as an artist working in the background, assets, menus and worked along side a concept artist for the characters. For this job I used both Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. Our Game designer did all of the documentation and put everything togheter on Unity. And our developer did the core functions of our game.</p>

                <h2>Delivery</h2>
                <p>After 48 hours (and in a weekend, thank god, no need to rush to class haha), we've finished our project! Or almost finished, the only thing we couldn't get on time was the music sadly. But it was functionally finished!
                    After delivering, we presented our game for the whole crowd with live gameplay. We didn't find any bug for the presentation and had a blast playing! Sadly, our game got judged and didn't reach the podium this time. However, as I said previously, I am really proud of this game, was a great point of connection with great friends and I still believe it's a really fun concept...but I do agree it's not for everyone's stomach hahah.</p>
